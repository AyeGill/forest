\p{We discussed the algebra generated by an e-presentation in \ref{ocl-000Z}, but we can also generate e-presentations. Specifically, consider the category where the objects are tuples #{(X, U \into TX, R \subset U \times U)} of a generating object #{X}, an arbitray subobject of terms, and an arbitrary relation on that subobject. There is a forgetful functor from #{\EPres_T} to this, which sends #{(X, D \into TX, e \colon D \onto E)} to #{(X, D, R_e)}, where #{R_e} is the equivalence relation generated by #{e}.}

\p{This should have a left adjoint, which "fills out" the collection of terms downwards to make a semi-subalgebra, and completes the relation to a partial congruence.}
