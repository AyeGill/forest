\p{David Jaz wants a definition of double (coloured) operads/multicategories. These should be guys such that 
vertical morphisms are unary, horizontal morphisms are #{n}-ary, and (thus) cells have boundary given by
two horizontal morphisms, one vertical morphism, and one list of vertical morphisms. The key is that composition
of horizontal morphisms can only be pseudo.}
\p{The most obvious way to get these things seemed to be to generalize Cruttwell-Shulman to the pseudo case,
so that a double operad would be something like a normalized pseudo-monoid in the horizontal Kleisli double category 
of the free (symmetric) monoidal category monad on the double category of profunctors. But you can't define 
pseudo-monoids in a (virtual) double category! If you think about spans of categories, you might note that this is
more than a mere double category, and try to think about some kind of double category with maps between the cells. But this is exhausting.}
\p{A quite different approach is to generalize the definition of \em{pseudo-double categories} as pseudo-algebras for the free category monad on the double category of categories internal to graphs! Thus let a #{T}-graph be a span #{TV\leftarrow E\to V} where #{T} is a monad. Graphs are #{\id}-graphs. #{T}-categories are #{T}-graphs equipped with an identity-assigning map of spans from #{V\leftarrow V\to V} (over the unit of #{T} on the left, see below) and a composition
map from #{E\times_V E} to #{E} (over the multiplication of #{T} on the left). In any reasonable case there will be a free #{T}-category monad on #{T}-graphs, which will extend to a levelwise-free-category monad on the double category of \em{internal categories in }#{T}-graphs with their functors and profunctors.}

\p{You should picture an internal category in #{T}-graphs as having a #{T}-graph of objects, with its #{T}-shaped 
edges drawn horizontally, and a #{T}-graph of vertical edges, with \em{its} edges drawn horizontally as families of squares. We can compose these vertical edges and the squares come along for the ride. But there's no way to compose 
horizontal edges, yet. An actual algebra for the free #{T}-multicategory monad in here would be a #{T}-multicategory internal to categories or a category internal to #{T}-multicategories; to get the desired pseudo-ness, we just ask for pseudo-algebras.}
\p{There's an extra complication when you want symmetric double operads, since then #{T} needs to be a monad on #{\Cat} (namely the free symmetric monoidal category monad). For this we only want to consider the categories internal to #{T}-graphs with discrete categories of vertices and edges. I bet this'll be made clearer by considering the case that #{T} is a \em{relative} monad #{T:\cat{A}\to \cat{B},} and then considering #{T}-graphs as graphs #{TV\leftarrow JE\to JV,} where #{J} is the inclusion of #{\cat{A}} into #{\cat{B}}.}

\p{I am not quite sure about the profunctors of #{T}-double categories as in the definition above, they're the same as profunctors of #{T}-virtual double categories but I think the two notions don't coincide for #{T=\id}.}
