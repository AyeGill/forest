\p{The category of 2-categories and 2-functors admits four important closure operations. The most obvious one is adjoint to the cartesian product and produces the 3-category of 2-categories, 2-functors, strictly 2-natural transformations, and modifications. Since the squares in the cartesian product #{A\times B} of two categories are "filled in", this can be called the "black" product of 2-categories.}
\p{The other closures correspond to weakening the notion of 2-natural transformation to, respectively, pseudo, lax, and oplax transformation. A oplax transformation between 2-functors #{F,G} means filling in the naturality squares in a direction that \emph{agrees} with the transformation's components, like so:}

\p{For this reason, it sometimes feels like oplax transformations are actually more natural than lax ones. But in, say, monoidal categories the lax functors are more important--so it goes. Lax natural transformations reverse the direction of #{\alpha_f}, and pseudo-natural transformations make it an isomorphism. Of course, the #{\alpha_f} have to respect composition and identities.}
\p{\emph{Without} changing the 2-functors or the modifications, we then produce our other three closures with respectively the pseudo, lax, and oplax transformations as morphisms in #{A^B}. These three functors are right adjoint to three different "gray" tensor products; the thing to remember about these is that the pseudo, lax, or oplax "gray" tensor product of an arrow with itself is a pseudo, lax, or oplax-commutative square. (The "white" tensor product is the "funny" tensor product that already exists for categories, where an arrow tensors with itself to a non-commutative square; this is adjoint to a fifth, mostly dumb, closure where the morphisms in #{A^B} are \emph{unnatural} transformations.)}
\p{This gives four different symmetric monoidal closed categories of 2-categories, using the strict/black, pseudo, lax, and oplax tensor products. Inspired by the notation of 2-dimensional universal algebra, we denote these #{\Gray^w} for #{w\in \{s,p,\ell,o\}}. (Thus we're calling the black product the "strict" Gray tensor product. All flames will be forwarded to dev/null.)}
