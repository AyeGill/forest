\title{Online Convex Optimization}
\taxon{definition}
\p{
  The problem of online convex optimization is as follows: A game is played over #{N} rounds.
  In each round, the player picks #{x_i \in \RR^k}, and then the adversary chooses some convex #{f_i: \RR^k \to \RR}, which may depend on #{x_i}. The goal of the player is to minimize (and the goal of the adversary, to maximize) the \em{regret:}
  ##{R = \sup_{x^*} \sum_{i=1}^N f_i(x_i) - f_i(x^*)}
}
