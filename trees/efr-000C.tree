\p{Let #{X_i \in \cC} be a collection of objects with coproduct #{\sum_i X_i}. Let #{A \in \cC}.
Then the family of lenses #{\binom{A}{X_i} \to \binom{A}{\sum_i X_i}} given by the inclusions as the forwards pass, and the projection #{X_i \times A \to A} as the backwards pass, is a coproduct diagram.}
