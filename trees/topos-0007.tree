\p{In category theory, we are often interested in enriched categories and internal categories.
Defining enriched categories requires some choice of monoidal category #{\cV}, and all the homs will
be objects of #{\cV}. So for #{\cV}-enriched, you have a set of objects and an object of #{\cV} of Homs 
for each pair of objects. But wll be more interested in internal categories. For a category #{\cE},
\em{both} the objects and homs of an internal category in #{\cE} are objects of #{\cE}.}
