\p{
	Categorical Systems Theory has an old tradition, probably starting wtih Rosen's 1958 paper.
	It lived in a pre-paradigmatic phase for a long time, until our lord and saviour [[david-jaz-myers]] tied up some loose ends and produced an organized theory, expounded in his book [[djm-categorical-systems-theory]].
