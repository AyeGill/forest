\title{Multiple workspaces}
\taxon{feature}

\p{A single silviculture server should support multiple "workspaces", which would allow different groups of people to collaborate on different projects without seeing each others changes until synced with [[silviculture-000E]].}

\p{\strong{Feasibility.} Requires semi-major refactor, but there aren't too many tricky design decisions about how it should work, or technical questions on how to make it work.}
