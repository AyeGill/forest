\p{In this post, I investigate the question of whether the category of topoi is cartesian closed.}

\p{Given two topoi #{\cX} and #{\cY}, the category of geometric morphisms #{\Hom_{\ToposCat}(\cX, \cY)} is \em{not} a logos. However, the category of all functors #{\Sh(\cX)^{\Sh(\cY)}} is a logos, as #{\Sh(\cX)^C} is a logos for any category #{C}. So the question is then if we define #{[\cX, \cY]} to be the topos whose corresponding logos is the functor category #{\Sh(\cX)^{\Sh(\cY)}}.}
