\p{This afternoon at the Topos-Oxford workshop we had in effect a talk from Owen on port Hamiltonian systems. I hadn't had the slightest idea about the latter before now so it was good to get a bit of a start.}
\p{The foundation is the standard Hamiltonian mechanics, with a configuration space #{X} and a Hamiltonian #{H:X\to \R.} This induces the 1-form #{dH} from which we want to get a vector field; the thing we need to do this is a tensor #{J:\Gamma(T^*X\to TX).} Then the contraction #{J(dH)} is the desired vector field. By a bit of calculus, you can find that #{J} has to be skew-symmetric to get trajectories of #{J(dH)} to be in level sets of #{H}, which is the law of conservation of energy.}
\p{This situation can be abstracted using the notion of Dirac relation. A Bond bundle is an even-dimensional vector bundle equipped with a quadratic form #{Q}, and a Dirac relation is a half-dimensional subbundle contained in the zero-set of #{Q.} The example from the previous case is #{TX\oplus T^*X} with #{Q(v,\alpha)=\alpha(v).} The Dirac relation is the graph of the symplectic form.}
\p{Then, port Hamiltonians add a new trivial Bond bundle #{V=V\times X} giving the interface of your system--in coordinates, #{V=(e,f)} where #{e} is the (external) effort and #{f} is the flow. These words seem to be abstractions of the notions of force and velocity, so you might initially imagine adding some external driving force to your system. Anyway, a Dirac relation on #{T^*X\oplus TX\oplus V} together with a Hamiltonian #{X\to \R} is a port Hamiltonian system, and that's pretty much where we got.}
