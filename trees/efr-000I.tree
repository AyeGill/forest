\title{Notes on Myers' Categorical Systems Theory}
\p{These are personal notes on [[categorical-systems-theory]] by [[david-jaz-myers]]. Since the book is very well-written, I highly advise reading it. And since Myers himself is a contributor to this forest, it is not generally my intention that these should be the \em{definitive} articles on here for any of these topics, although anyone is of course welcome to transclude instead of writing their own.}
