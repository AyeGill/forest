\p{Every pseudo double category #{\DD} is "equivalent" to some strict double category #{\DD'}.}

\p{Proof is analogous to the proof of the \nlab{coherence theorem for monoidal categories}.}

\p{However, it may not be very "natural" to work with the strictification of a given pseudo double category. So we normally work with pseudo double categories, but pretend that they are strict double categories.}
