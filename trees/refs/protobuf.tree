\p{Protocol Buffers are language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanisms for serializing structured data.}

\notes{
  \ul{
    \li{Protobuf assigns numbers to each field of a struct. This seems to be in order to support migrations. We should do better than this via explicit migrations.}
    \li{Protobuf supports enumerations, but not tagged unions.}
  }
