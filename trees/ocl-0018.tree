\p{I think that the biggest change in my approach to academic writing over the last couple years has been an increasing appreciation for [citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation), and tracking the history of ideas.}

\p{When I wrote my undergraduate thesis, citations were a chore. I would write what I want to write, and then retroactively search for relevant work to fulfill the obligation of citation. However, since then I've learned the value of reading bibliographies and following ideas backwards \em{and} forward (i.e. looking at what papers cite the paper I'm currently reading). When you are careful about citation, your writing becomes part of the larger conversation that takes place on the scale of centuries. People use citations to measure quality (just as google uses backlinks to organize search results), but the point of citations is not point-scoring, the point is maintaining the web of knowledge of humanity.}

\p{This isn't really supposed to be a revelation, just a thought I had that I wrote down. Probably should add more citations to this.}
