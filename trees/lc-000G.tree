\title{Contributing}

\p{To contribute to the forest, you can send a pull request to the [github repository](https://github.com/LocalCharts/forest). The README in the github repository has instructions for how to set up a local environment for writing. Additionally, if you have been around in the LocalCharts community for a reasonable amount of time, you can DM [Owen Lynch](https://www.localcharts.org/u/owenlynch) and ask for write access to the github so that you don't have to go through an approval step before pushing to the repo.}

\p{In any case, when you contribute to the forest, you should do a couple things. First of all, you should add yourself to the \code{trees/authors} folder (you can see [owen-lynch.tree](https://github.com/LocalCharts/forest/tree/main/trees/authors/owen-lynch.tree) for an example of this). Then you should claim a namespace. For instance, Owen's posts all start with ocl (Owen Carroll Lynch), i.e. \code{ocl-0001}, \code{ocl-0002}. You might end up typing this a lot, so initials are good. You can generate new trees in a namespace using the \code{new} script in the repository, so for instance \code{new ocl} makes a new file within the ocl namespace, numbered with the next number.}
