\p{I will be taking notes on [repl.it](https://replit.com/@olynch/forest) during the Davidad's second ARIA Workshop. If you would like to join my collaborative session in a google-docs-like fashion, reach out to me either via DM on [localcharts](https://www.localcharts.org) or via the category theory zulip, or via any other means you have at your disposal.}

\p{You can see the live-updating notes [here](https://fe4c8d58-a033-4576-8a20-909cc6f47a50-00-jxvz73lbppio.spock.replit.dev/ocl-001K.xml), but note that the lifespan of that URL is unclear.}
