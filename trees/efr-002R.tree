  The inequality
  ##{f(\theta x + (1-\theta)x') \leq \theta f(x) + (1-\theta)f(x'),}
  which holds whenever #{f} is convex, is called \em{Jensen's inequality}.
  Sometimes this name is used for a stronger version of this inequality,
  like the claim that #{f(\EE X) \leq \EE f(X)} if #{X} is a random variable valued in the domain of #{f}. These generally follow just from convexity of #{f}.
