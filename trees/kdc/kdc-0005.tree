\title{Subobjects of possibilistic dynamical systems}

\p{A \emph{discrete possibilistic dynamical system} (dpds) is a Kleisli morphism for the nonempty powerset monad #{\mathcal P^+:\mathcal E\to\mathcal E}, that is, a morphism
#{d_X:X\to\mathcal{P}^+(X)} where #{\mathcal{P}^+(X)} is the set of nonempty subsets of #{X}. Note that #{\mathcal E} is at least a topos, here--indeed, for the \emph{nonempty} powerset monad to be well behaved we may need to be in a \emph{Boolean} topos. I'm not sure how necessary of a restriction this is. For possibilistic systems, think of something like one agent's model of the behavior of another agent with a comparable complexity. Especially if I don't know you personally, there's a range of things I imagine you might do while reading this paragraph: get bored and give up, go make a cup of tea, look at an email on your phone, or keep reading, and while in some sense I could probably assign probabilities to these outcomes, I think it is actually bad modeling to insist on pretending I'm doing so, when that's just not actually how I think about you: there are plausible actions, as well as things I'm substantially sure you won't do, and that's it.}
\p{Strict morphisms of dpds are the obvious thing: a map #{f:X\to X'} of state spaces such that #{d_{X'}\circ f=\mathcal{P}^+(f)\circ d_X.} A key point I have to make is what this means for subobjects: they're just the maps of dpds whose underlying map is mono in #{\mathcal E}, and what this means for the dynamics is \emph{a subsystem of a dpds, in the most obvious sense, is a subobject of the state space from which it is \emph{impossible} to ever escape.}}
\p{This question of subsystems arose at the Boundaries workshop in the context of Nathaniel Osgood, Manuel Baltieri, Martin Biehl, and Matteo Capucci's work on a control theoretic approach to agent-environment boundaries. Here there is a specified "good" subspace of state space, which might be the subspace where the agent stays alive, and we look for a subobject of the system contained in this good space--this means a region of state space within which, having once entered, the agent will always remain. In generalizing from deterministic dynamical systems to possibilistic ones, then, the most natural move produces the notion of a set of states from which the agent can never depart, no matter what decision it makes. This is a natural and useful concept, but it's certainly not the only one we might propose. If we think the agent is smart and makes good decisions (hopefully), then it's enough for survival if the agent \emph{can} always stay in the viable region.}
\p{To this end, consider a less obvious category whose objects are still dpds. For this, it's critical that the algebras for #{\mathcal P^+} actually form a 2-category, because the powerset is of course a poset, not just a set. Therefore we could just as well define a \emph{lax} morphism of dpds using the square below; since powersets are just posets, there is a unique choice of the arrow filling the square, and all it says in elements is that #{d_{X'}\circ f(x)\subseteq\mathcal{P}^+(f)\circ d_X(x)} for all #{x\in X}.

\quiver{\begin{tikzcd}
	X & {X'} \\
	\mathcal P^+(X) & \mathcal P^+(X')
	\arrow["{d_X}", from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow["{d_{X'}}", from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow["f"{description}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["{\mathcal P^+(f)}"', from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow[Rightarrow, from=1-2, to=2-1]
\end{tikzcd}}}

\p{This condition on #{X\to X'} says that #{X} is equipped with its own dynamics, and that every state reachable from #{x} in #{X} is also so reachable in #{X'}. In particular, since we're using #{\mathcal P^+}, there is always a move from #{x} to another point in #{X}, which means we've successfully formalized a notion of a possibilistic subsystem in which it's \emph{possible}, rather than \emph{unavoidable}, to remain permanently. Note that we've mildly modified the intuitive notion in that #{X} comes with its own dynamics that might not be maximal with respect to making #{X} a lax subobject--there is always a maximal such choice, if it's nonempty, given by intersecting each #{d_{X'}(x)} with #{X}. This is a kind of "induced" subobject in analogy with the concept of induced subgraph; in categorical terms these are the \emph{extremal} monomorphisms of the category of dpds and lax maps. You might also note that this category of dpds and lax maps looks like it should be a 2-category; but I don't think there's any reasonable way to add 2-morphisms (which would be modifications) since the state spaces are discrete.}
